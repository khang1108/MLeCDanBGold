# Shared schemas

This package contains the Pydantic models and enums shared by the retrieval
pipeline, evaluation tools, and public API. The schemas are intentionally
strict: `ContractModel` rejects unknown fields and strips surrounding
whitespace from strings.

## Modules and definitions

### `base.py`

- `NonEmptyString`: an `Annotated[str, ...]` type that strips whitespace and
  requires at least one character.
- `ContractModel`: base Pydantic model for shared contracts. Extra fields are
  forbidden and string fields are stripped of surrounding whitespace.

### `enum.py`

- `SearchMode`: search profile (`fast` or `accuracte`).
- `ProcessingStatus`: offline processing state: `pending`, `processing`,
  `completed`, or `failed`.
- `RetrievalSource`: evidence source used during retrieval: `visual`,
  `caption`, `ocr`, or `asr`.
- `QueryLanguage`: query language: Vietnamese (`vi`), English (`en`), or
  mixed (`mixed`).
- `TaskType`: evaluation task: `textual_kis`, `video_kis`, `ad_hoc_search`,
  or `vqa`.
- `QueryDifficulty`: evaluation difficulty: `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`.

### `frame.py`

- `FrameRecord`: canonical metadata for one searchable frame. It preserves the
  authoritative `frame_idx` and `timestamp_ms` rather than deriving one from
  the other.
- `FrameEnrichment`: offline caption, OCR, ASR, object-label, model, and
  processing-status metadata associated with a `frame_id`. Duplicate object
  labels are removed while preserving order.

### `retrieval.py`

- `RetrievalCandidate`: internal candidate passed between retrieval stages. It
  stores per-source scores and ranks, fusion/reranker/final scores, and
  optional metadata. Source ranks must be positive one-based integers.
- `SearchScores`: scores exposed for a returned frame, including visual,
  caption, OCR, ASR, fusion, reranker, and final scores.

### `search.py`

- `SearchFilters`: optional video and time-range restrictions. Video IDs are
  deduplicated, and `end_time_ms` cannot precede `start_time_ms`.
- `SearchRequest`: public search request containing a non-empty query, a
  bounded `top_k`, search mode, and optional filters.
- `SearchLatency`: non-negative latency measurements for each search stage and
  the total request, in milliseconds.
- `SearchResult`: one ranked result with the canonical frame identifiers,
  preview URLs, enrichment text, and scores.
- `SearchResponse`: complete search response with request metadata, latency,
  results, and warnings. `total_results` must match the result list and cannot
  exceed `top_k`.

### `evaluation.py`

- `EvaluationQuery`: labelled query for offline evaluation. It contains the
  query metadata, gold frame/video IDs, temporal tolerance, tags, and optional
  notes. ID and tag lists are deduplicated while preserving order.

### `conversation.py`

- `ConversationTurn`: one user or system message in a KIS conversation.
- `FrameFeedback`: human feedback represented as accepted and rejected frame
  ID lists.

## Importing

Import shared base types and the public package exports like this:

```python
from aic.common.schemas import ContractModel, NonEmptyString
```

For models that are defined in a module but are not re-exported by
`__init__.py`, import them from their defining module:

```python
from aic.common.schemas.frame import FrameRecord
from aic.common.schemas.search import SearchRequest, SearchResponse
```

`__all__` in `__init__.py` documents the symbols intentionally re-exported
from the package root. Prefer explicit imports in application code.
